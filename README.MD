# DiscordAssistant

Some bots are [forbidden](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots-) from discord so be careful, thats not my issue.

## Getting started

- `npm i`
- `node src/index.js`

## Functionalities

### Evaluate JS code

Put `{eval}\n` at the beginig of your message followed by your code

### Reference to a previous message

Put `{ref:<messageId>}` in your message and will add a reference to this message
